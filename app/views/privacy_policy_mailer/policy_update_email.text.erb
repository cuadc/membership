Dear CUADC Members & Alumni,

I do hope you're well. I'm Em Sparkes, the current president of the
CUADC, and I'm writing to you to let you know that we're taking exciting
steps with CUDAR to build a longstanding and meaningful relationship
with our Alumni to facilitate alumni interaction, communication and
fundraising. As part of this, we've updated our privacy policy, and
we'll be sharing names, colleges, CRSids and graduation years of our
members from 2015 onwards with the University of Cambridge Development &
Alumni Relations office. The new privacy policy can be viewed at the
link below.

However, we understand some members may not wish to have their
information shared with CUDAR, and if you do not agree with this new
policy, please follow this link to do so.

Providing you're happy for us to share your data (in which instance you
won't need to do anything) you'll be receiving the first newsletter from
the CUADC soon, and we can't wait to get to know you better!

With very best wishes,
Em Sparkes
