Dear <%= @member.name %>,

This is an automated message from the CUADC Membership System. Please do

Your membership card is now ready for collection from the ADC Theatre.
Please find it waiting for you in the Membership pigeon hole in the
Management Corridor, next to door through to the Box Office. Cards are
often processed in batches so if there is a collection, please sort
through it until you find your own.

Please contact the Membership Secretary (members@cuadc.org) if you
encounter any issues in collecting your membership card.

With kind regards & very best wishes,

The CUADC Membership System
