  The CUADC Membership System is a piece of software originally developed by
  <a href="https://charliejonas.co.uk/">Charlie Jonas</a>, the CUADC Webmaster
  2017-18. It's designed to aid the Membership Secretary in their job and to
  facilitate electronically checking an entire show's membership at once.
