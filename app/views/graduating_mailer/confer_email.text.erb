Dear <%= @member.name %>,

This is an automated message from the CUADC Membership System, but
replies to this address are monitored.

This is to inform you that in line with the constitution, you have now
been conferred Associate Membership of the Club. We have done this
because we believe you are no longer a student at the University of
Cambridge, or are no longer a student at a higher educational
establishment and resident within the City of Cambridge.

If this is a mistake, please urgently apprise us of your situation by
replying to this email. This is important if you wish to continue taking
part in student shows.

Further, the contact email address we have on file for you is shown
below. If this is no longer accurate or you have another preferred
address, please get in touch so that we can continue to inform you of
events such as the annual Club Dinner and Garden Party.
