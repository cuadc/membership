Dear <%= @member.name %>,

This is an automated message from the CUADC Membership System, but
replies to this address are monitored.

According to our records, you are a current student who will be
graduating this summer, or who has already graduated at some other point
this year.

In line with the Club's constitution, those who are no longer current
students are conferred Associate Membership and as such, we will soon be
updating your record in our system to reflect this.

If you will *not* be graduating this summer or will be staying to pursue
a further course of study (such as a Master's degree), please get in
touch by replying to this email to update us of your situation.

Kind regards,

The CUADC Membership System
