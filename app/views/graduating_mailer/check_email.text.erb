Dear <%= @member.name %>,

This is an automated message from the CUADC Membership System, but

According to our records, you are a current student who will be

In line with the Club's constitution, those who are no longer current
students are conferred Associate Membership and as such, we will soon be
updating your record in our system to reflect this.

If you will *not* be graduating this summer or will be staying to pursue
a further course of study (such as a Master's degree), please get in
touch by replying to this email to update us of your situation. This is
important for those who wish to continue taking part in student shows.

Further, the contact email address we have on file for you is show

continue to inform you of events such as the annual Club Dinner and
Garden Party.
