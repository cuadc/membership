# CUADC Membership System
The CUADC Membership System is a web application used by the Membership Secretary pro tempore of the Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club for managing the details of the society's paid up members.

The system runs as a Ruby on Rails app and speaks to a MySQL database on the backend.
Please note the this project is currently a work in progress.

## Contributing
The intention is to keep the project very simple and provide nothing more than a basic web frontend for the membership database. That being said, if you do notice something that's broken, could use improvement or is otherwise not working properly then please do contribute! You can submit bug reports, feature requests and pull requests on GitHub.
